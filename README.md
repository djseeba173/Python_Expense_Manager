# Python_Expense_Manager
Hi! This is an Expense Manager I made with Python.

As it's name says, it allows one to input the amount of money spent (price), the description of the item bought
and the category that the item would fit in.

When viewing the items, you can order them either by the price (asc or desc) or the category.
